# Introduction
A MIT open source cross mobile platform 2D/3D c++ game engine.
Mainly focus on mobile platform,support win32,ios,android(not yet).
Current version is 0.1, it's still under heavy developing.I write it and use it to developy my own mobile games.
More docs and examples will be added later.

# Features:
* Fast Auto Batch rendering
* Auto relative UI layout,template based
* Actions behaviours
* BMP font and TTF font
* Spine skeleton animation support
* Tield map support
* Texture atlas support
* Audio engine,ogg
* Use lua as script language
* Custom file package format,support easy merge,diff,defrag,resource manage,Encrypting
* Custom data protocol (called "Siren",using C# as DSL)
* OpenGLES(2.0 & 3.0)

# Next plan:
* Port to Android
* particle system

# Introduction:
* MedusaCore is a game irrelevant lib that provide a lot useful tools can be used in other projects. Medusa use it as core cpp lib providing "string manipulate,collection like STL,Math,socket,file system..etc. delegate".I made a lot wheels to make cpp simpler to use.
* Medusa is the game engine.
* MedusaExtension is the project to add other SDKs in.
* MedusaProto includes C# files to describe C++ serializable structs.
* Siren is the C# engine to generate C++ code files from C# data classes.
* External dir includes all 3rd party libs.
* Test, you can run Test project to check what features this engine provided. But I'm too busy to write enough examples,sorry about that,maybe reading source code would be more directly.
Tool dir includes some useful tool I created myself to generate C++ codes or packing tools.
